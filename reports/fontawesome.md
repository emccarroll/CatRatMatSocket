## Licensing

The following was copied from the [Font Awesome page on licensing][fa-license]:
* ### Icons
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types. 
* ### Fonts
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files. 
* ### Code
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files. 
* ### Attribution
    Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these files normally.

    We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to learn about Font Awesome. 

Dos | Don'ts
------------ | -------------
Use FA Free in your commercial projects. |      Use the Font Awesome name in the name of your project.
Use FA Free on your websites. | 
Embed FA Free in your mobile and desktop apps. |
Use FA Free in desktop apps. |
Embed FA Free in documents. (e.g. .pdf, .doc, etc.) |

This essentially means that as long as we don't use Font Awesome's name in the name of our project (see above), we can use Font Awesome Free for whatever purposes we need it for.
