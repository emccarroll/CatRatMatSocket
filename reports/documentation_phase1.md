# React Open-Source Report

## What does React accomplish for us?

React is a [_Javascript library for building user interfaces_][React-website]. We use it create interactive UIs and automatically update our changes in real time. This is useful as it reduces development time and adds a bunch of handy functionality to Javascript. We use react-router for routing, but we'll handle that in a different document.

Problems React solves for us:  

1. Templating HTML with Javascript
2. Dynamic rendering

## How does React accomplish what it does?

* ### Templating HTML
    going through source code ducking sucks. I don't wanna do it 
* ### Dynamic Rendering
